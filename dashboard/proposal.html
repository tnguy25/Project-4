	  <div class="part-1">
		<p>Our project aims to investigate the impact of predictive analytics on student success. Predictive analytics is increasingly being used in the education sector to identify at-risk students, optimize educational resources, and improve learning outcomes. However, it is essential to understand the societal implications of these practices.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h2 class="major">Key Questions</h2>
	  <div class="part-1">
		<ol>
		  <li>How effective are predictive analytics models in identifying successful and at-risk student in post-secondary education, when looking at <b>non-academic performance related</b> demographic data as predictors? 'Successful' and 'at-risk' for our purposes are defined as likely to graduate or drop out, respectively. Factors we will look at:
			<ul>
			  <li>Students' parent background: Martital status, educational qualification, & occupation</li>
			  <li>Students' Nationality (National vs International & country of origin)</li>
			  <li>Unemployment & Inflation Rate at time of Student Enrollment</li>
			  <li>Student Scholarships</li>
			</ul></li>
		  <li>What policy recommendations can be made to ensure the responsible use of predictive analytics in education?</li>
		  <li>What are the ethical considerations and potential biases associated with using predictive analytics in education?</li>
		</ol>

	  <h2 class="major">Data Sources</h2>
	  <div class="part-1">
		<p>To conduct this analysis, we initially wanted to look at Canadian or US data, but found that student-centric data is generally not publically available. Therefore, we used a dataset from the <b>UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</b> collected from institutions in Portugal. For instance, <a href ="https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success">https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success</a></p>
